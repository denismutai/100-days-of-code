# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 14th 2022
##### Installed Ubuntu, VS Code and Chrome browser on my machine as per the advice of The Odin Project. I also introduced myself to the shell and went over basic commands on navigating files and directories, working with files and directories, and pipes and filters. 

**Today's Progress**: The major progress for me today is that I was able to use the command line to create a project, its directories, and files. I also familiarized myself with basic Git commmands involved in moving files to and from Github and learned how to take the snapshot of my code.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with the bash terminal but I am happy because I finally know how to use command line superpowers to seemlessly manage coding projects and using it to keep track of progress.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
